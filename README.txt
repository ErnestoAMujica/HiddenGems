HOW TO GET THIS TO RUN:

CLIENT:
Download node.js (https://nodejs.org/en ver 20.11.0 LTS)
Run npm install react @types/react in client folder
run npm install next in client folder in client folder
run npm install @radix-ui/themes
npm run dev in client folder
client is now running at http://localhost:3000/

SERVER:
install python if not already installed, add to path variable during installation
run pip install -r ./server/venv/requirements.txt
run python3 server.py in server/venv
server is now running at http://localhost:8080/api/home


Note: you only need to do this once (aside from npm run dev and python3 server.py) and this just prevents you from having to push the constantly changing node files everytime you make any change to the project
