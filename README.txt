HOW TO GET THIS TO RUN:

CLIENT:
Download node.js (https://nodejs.org/en ver 20.11.0 LTS)
Run npm install react @types/react in client folder
run npm install next in client folder
npm run dev
client is now running at http://localhost:3000/

SERVER:
install python if not already installed, add to path variable during installation
run pip install -r ./server/venv/requirements.txt
run python3 server.py
server is now running at http://localhost:8080/api/home


Note: you only need to do this once and this just prevents you from having to push the constantly changing node files everytime you make any change to the project
